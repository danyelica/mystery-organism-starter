# Codecademy Challenge: Mystery Organism Starter

## The challenge proposed:
1. Create a function which takes two parameters and returns an object with the followings properties:
  - A number;
  - An array with the DNA bases;
  - A method called .mutate() that changes one random item of the object for another random item different than the picked one;
  - A method called .compareDNA() that compares the current object with an array given as argument. This method returns the percentage of common DNA the two arrays have;
  - A method called .willLikelySurvive() that check if the object has 60% of 'C' or 'G' as items;
 2. Uses the created function to generate 30 randoms objects;
